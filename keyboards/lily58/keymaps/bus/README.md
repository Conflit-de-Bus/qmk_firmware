# SORRY
This keymap does not work properly, I wanted to test it but the usb port on the left side of my keyboard is broken

Thanks micro USB

It was already a miracle that I managed to flash a firmware on it without bricking it, so I will not fix the little issues:

- The รง character should be printed with the upper+C combination
- The OLED screen on the left half is static (I copy-pasted my sofle config)
- Maybe other things that I will discover later

I will try to fix it if I get equipement to de-solder the pro-micro, or if I build another Lily58.
